# Bossanova — vr-ep1/q65-bb-j

Episode1; header quest ID 65; language J. Static scan: **152 objects, 24 enemy/NPC records, 3 events, 356 script labels.** Script roundtrip: alignment-only.

This is a structural dossier, not a claim that every branch has been manually interpreted or playtested. Enemy/NPC records are not gameplay kill totals. Event IDs, wave numbers, object groups and script labels are distinct namespaces.

## Read and inspect

- [Reassembly syntax with explicit labels](<script.txt>)
- [Complete placements and event actions](<map.txt>)
- [Every parsed wave and its next actions](<waves.csv>)
- [Object fields](<objects.csv>)
- [Enemy/NPC fields](<enemies.csv>)

## Area designations

Operands: floor, area, type, layout variation, entities variation.

## Floors

| Floor | Objects | Enemy/NPC records | Events |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 24 | 19 | 0 |
| 10 | 26 | 0 | 0 |
| 11 | 23 | 1 | 1 |
| 12 | 16 | 1 | 1 |
| 13 | 28 | 2 | 0 |
| 14 | 35 | 1 | 1 |

## Wave progression

Numbers below are decimal; delays are frames. Alternatives and parallel triggers must not be mistaken for one compulsory sequence.

| Floor | Event | Room / wave | Records | Delay | Completion actions |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 11 | 1 | 1 / 1 | 1 | 50 | construct_objects(room=1,group_or_wave=1); stop |
| 12 | 1 | 1 / 1 | 1 | 50 | construct_objects(room=1,group_or_wave=1); stop |
| 14 | 1 | 0 / 1 | 1 | 50 | construct_objects(room=0,group_or_wave=1); construct_objects(room=1,group_or_wave=1); construct_objects(room=2,group_or_wave=1); stop |

## Review notes

No structural or event-destination issues found by these checks. This does not establish reachability or runtime correctness.
